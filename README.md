- **libraries**: Stores custom PHP libraries and third-party dependencies used in the application.
- **logs**: Placeholder directory for storing application logs.
- **models**: Houses PHP models representing data entities and interacting with the database.
- **third_party**: Placeholder directory for third-party libraries or modules.

### Files:

- **index.html**: Default landing page for the server project.
- **test.php**: A PHP script for testing purposes.
- **welcome_message.php**: PHP script generating a welcome message for the application's homepage.

### How to Use:

1. Ensure that PHP is installed on your server environment.
2. Configure the settings in the `config` directory, especially `config.php` and `database.php`, according to your environment.
3. Utilize the controllers in the `controllers` directory to define application logic and handle HTTP requests.
4. Interact with the database using the models defined in the `models` directory.
5. Customize and extend the functionality of the application by adding new controllers, models, libraries, and helpers as needed.
6. Refer to the `views` directory for HTML templates and error pages.
